/*
    0: Default mode, balanced performance.
    1: Short range, high speed. Uses 0x1d maximum acquisition count.
    2: Default range, higher speed short range. Turns on quick termination
        detection for faster measurements at short range (with decreased
        accuracy)
    3: Maximum range. Uses 0xff maximum acquisition count.
    4: High sensitivity detection. Overrides default valid measurement detection
        algorithm, and uses a threshold value for high sensitivity and noise.
    5: Low sensitivity detection. Overrides default valid measurement detection
        algorithm, and uses a threshold value for low sensitivity and noise.
